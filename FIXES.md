# Bug Fixes - Badge Count & Test Page Domain

## Issues Fixed

### Issue 1: Insights Badge Shows 0 on Popup Open ✅

**Problem:** The help request count badge in the Insights tab showed 0 when opening the popup, but updated when clicking the Insights tab.

**Root Cause:** The popup initialization only loaded settings and errors, but not the help request count. The count was only loaded when switching to the Insights tab.

**Fix:** 
- Created new `loadHelpCount()` function that loads only the help request count
- Added `await loadHelpCount()` to popup initialization in `DOMContentLoaded` event
- Now the badge shows the correct count immediately when popup opens

**Files Changed:**
- `extension/popup/popup.js` - Added `loadHelpCount()` function and call on init

### Issue 2: Monitoring System Test Page Not Working ✅

**Problem:** The test-monitoring.html page (served on localhost:5000 through Replit proxy) wasn't activating the monitoring system.

**Root Cause:** The domain check in the monitoring scripts only checked for:
- `qase.io`
- `app.qase`
- `localhost`

But the Replit test server uses a proxy domain like `*.replit.dev` or `*.repl.co`, which didn't match.

**Fix:**
- Updated `checkQaseDomain()` in all three monitoring scripts to include:
  - `.replit.dev` (Replit proxy domains)
  - `.repl.co` (Replit proxy domains)
- The monitoring system now works on both app.qase.io AND the test pages

**Files Changed:**
- `extension/monitoring/activity-tracker.js`
- `extension/monitoring/context-analyzer.js`
- `extension/monitoring/dom-observer.js`

## Testing Instructions

### Test Fix #1 (Badge Count)
1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome (`chrome://extensions/` → reload button)
2. Visit app.qase.io and trigger some help requests
3. **Close the extension popup**
4. **Click extension icon** to reopen popup
5. ✅ Badge should show correct count immediately (not 0)

### Test Fix #2 (Test Page Monitoring)
1. **Reload the extension** in Chrome
2. Visit http://localhost:5000/test-monitoring.html
3. Open browser console (F12)
4. Look for console messages:
   - "Qase Activity Tracker: Initialized on [hostname]"
   - "Context Analyzer: Initialized on [hostname]"
   - "Qase DOM Observer: Active on [hostname]"
5. Click the behavior test buttons
6. Open extension popup → Insights tab
7. ✅ Help requests should appear based on test behaviors
