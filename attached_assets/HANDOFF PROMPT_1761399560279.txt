HANDOFF PROMPT: Qase AI Testing Assistant Chrome Extension (v0.2.0)

Project Context:
You are taking over development of a Chrome Extension (Manifest V3) that serves as a proactive AI testing assistant for Qase.io. The extension has completed Phase 2 and is production-ready.

Current Status:

Version: 0.2.0
Phase 1 Complete: JavaScript error detection, Qase API integration, defect reporting
Phase 2 Complete: Proactive AI context monitoring (activity tracking, help scoring, DOM observation)
Architecture Overview:

Extension Components:
├── background.js - Service worker (error queue + help requests)
├── content/content-script.js - Error detection
├── monitoring/ - Phase 2 AI system
│   ├── activity-tracker.js - User behavior patterns
│   ├── context-analyzer.js - Help score calculation
│   └── dom-observer.js - UI error detection
├── popup/ - Extension UI (3 tabs: Errors, Insights, Settings)
└── utils/ - API wrapper + storage helpers
Key Features:

Error Detection: Captures JS errors, promise rejections, console.error() calls
Qase Integration: Creates defect reports via API with smart retry logic
Activity Monitoring: Tracks rapid clicks, form abandonment, hesitation patterns
Context Analysis: Calculates help-needed scores (0.0-1.0) using weighted algorithm
DOM Observation: Detects validation errors, empty states, stuck loading
Privacy: Domain-gated monitoring (only on *.qase.io, localhost)
Testing:

test-page.html - Error detection validation
test-monitoring.html - Monitoring system validation
Load extension: chrome://extensions/ → Developer mode → Load unpacked
Next Development Goals:

Phase 3: CrewAI multi-agent integration
Phase 4: MCP (Model Context Protocol) support
Phase 5: LLM-powered features (automated suggestions, NL defect creation)
Important Notes:

All monitoring only activates on Qase domains (security/privacy)
Help threshold: 0.6 (60% confidence before offering help)
Extension uses storage-based queues (max 50 help requests, auto-cleanup after 1 hour)
No regressions: Phase 1 error detection still fully functional
Current Issue Fixed:
The Insights tab was not loading properly due to event listener overrides. This has been corrected.

Your Task:
Continue development from Phase 2. The extension is stable and ready for Phase 3 integration. All documentation is in README.md, PHASE2-README.md, and PROJECT-STATUS.md.

Debug Commands:

// Browser console (on test pages):
window.qaseActivityTracker.getSessionSummary()
window.qaseContextAnalyzer.getAnalysisHistory()
window.qaseForceAnalysis()
// Extension service worker:
chrome.storage.local.get(['helpRequests'], console.log)
chrome.storage.local.get(['errorQueue'], console.log)
Proceed with understanding the codebase and preparing for Phase 3 (CrewAI integration).
